Statement5.1 <-"This evaluation is part of the Hierarchical Decision Making (HDM) method.
          In this method a decision has been broken down into it's elements as a tree
          and you have been asked to compare each element in the tree against the others in
          proportion of their relative importance to the objective. Use the sliders
          on the Comparisons page to rate each pair. For example:"
Statement6.1 <-"If A is 3 times as important as B, A gets 75 points, B gets 25 points"
Statement7.1 <-"If the importance of A and B are the same, both get 50 points. This is
             the case regardless of whether both are extremely important, mildly important
             or unimportant."
Statement8.1 <-"If A is Â¼ as important as B, A gets 20 points, B gets 80 points."
Statement9.1 <-"Zero is not used in the pairwise comparisons. If the importance of
             A is negligible in comparison to B, A gets 1 point, B gets 99 points. "
