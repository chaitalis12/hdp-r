Description:  Hierarchical Decision Making (HDM) is a variation of the Analytic Hierarchy Process 
  (AHP)(Thomas Saatay) where a decision model is built as a tree, then pairwise comparisons 
  are used to quantify the model. HDP is the process used to conduct surveys and evaluate
  models with HDM. This package is designed to aid researchers in conducing the Hierarchical
  Decision Process utilizing HDM.
